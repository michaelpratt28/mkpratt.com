This project was initialized with Express and uses a PUG view manager and Node routing. This website features an alive parallax space environment with custom 3D objects made possible by THREE.js. Most of the 3D objects were custom built in Blender. These custom 3D objects utilize UV mapped textures. This website is mostly experimental in which I can give the vistor an experience different from most websites that use generic layouts and don't have much creativity. The design for this website was made in collaboration with Garth Pratt (garthpratt.com).
